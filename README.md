The next most important thing for our A.I. assistant is that it should take command with the help of the microphone of the user's system. So, now we will make a takeCommand() function.  With the help of the takeCommand() function, our A.I. assistant will return a string output by taking microphone input from the user.

 Before defining the takeCommand() function, we need to install a module called speechRecognition. Install this module by: 

pip install speechRecognition


To search something on Wikipedia 
 To do Wikipedia searches, we need to install and import the Wikipedia module into our program. Type the below command to install the Wikipedia module :

pip install wikipedia
